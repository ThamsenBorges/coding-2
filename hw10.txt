The TinkerCad Circuit and Codeblocks were very fun and simple, the circuit bit helped me understand the arudino stuff so maybe i'll revisit the past assignments. I enjoyed the challenge sections of making the shapes fit into a designated area. I think it's really good how they have the drag and place simplicity movement as well as the coding bars, it makes it a lot easier of to learn. There are a lot things to learn about on TinkerCad with good tutorials.
I created a Kobe Bryant trinket with a ring to hang it on a wall or something, I do wish I could have it printed. Keeping in basketball fashion I made a basketball hoop with a ball that goes in it, I guess i'm missing sports.  I had fun creating and making these things.
